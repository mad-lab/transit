Welcome! This is the distribution for the TRANSIT and TPP tools developed by the Ioerger Lab.

TRANSIT is a tool for the analysis of Tn-Seq data. It provides an easy to use graphical interface and access to three different analysis methods that allow the user to determine essentiality in a single condition as well as between conditions.
